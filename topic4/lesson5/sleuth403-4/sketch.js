Case 403 - Captured - stage 4

A coordinated action is under way to arrest Shiffman. Police are currently in pursuit on Meyers Way.
In order to catch him we must be able to alert all forces of his whereabouts according to the following rules:

- if Shiffman is within 133 meters from Torvald's House then alert local police by drawing a Indigo circle around it with a radius of 133 pixels.
- if Shiffman is in Wrong Side of the tracks then the neighbourhood watch must be notified by drawing a Chocolate rectangle around it.
- if Shiffman is in neither position, a global alert must be issued by drawing a PaleVioletRed rectangle covering the area between Ada Avenue, Gates Avenue, Meyers Way and Mullenweg Street.

Shiffman's position is signified by the mouse.

Note: all road coordinates are measured from their center.

Use X11 colours. You can find a reference table at https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-iccprof#numerical.

There are many possible ways of investigating this case, but you should use ONLY the following commands, operators and variables:

  if(){}
  >
  <
  &&
  else
  fill()  - Use r,g,b values between 0 and 255.
  dist()
  ellipse()
  rect()
  mouseX
  mouseY

    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);


    // a helpful mouse coordinate pointer
